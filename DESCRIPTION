Description: This package is born out of curiosity rather than necessity. 'sequentially' creates non-linear and linear numeric sequences. By using non-linear interpolation the user can animate their data
in a way that is more visually pleasing than uniform, linear interpolation. The functions in this package could be used in data visualization,
motion animation, frame interpolation, UI/UX design, population dynamics, economics and finance.
