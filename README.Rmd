This package is born out of curiosity rather than necessity. `sequentially` creates non-linear and linear numeric sequences. By using non-linear interpolation the user can animate their data
in a way that is more visually pleasing than uniform, linear interpolation. The functions in this package represent a break from the **essential** but *boring* `seq()` family of functions–I wanted to plot numeric sequences could be used in data visualization, motion animation, frame interpolation, UI/UX design, population dynamics, economics and finance.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sequentially like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("sequentially")
```

or download it from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("sequentially")
```


## What you get:

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(sequentially)

# Linear sequence from 0 to 10
 t <- seq(0,1,length.out = 100)
 lin_seq <- seq_smooth(0, 10, n = 100, type = "linear")
 plot.new()
 plot.window(range(t),range(lin_seq))
 points(t,lin_seq,pch = 16, cex = .75,col = "red")
 axis(1,tcl = 0.75,lwd = 0, family = "serif")
 axis(2,lwd = 0, family = "serif", las = 1)
 grid(2,3,col = "gray80",lty = "dotted", lwd = 0.50)
 mtext("Linear Sequence",3,cex = 1.3, family = "serif")


 # Elastic easing out sequence
 elastic_seq <- seq_smooth(0, 10, n = 100, type = "elastic", ease = "out")
 plot.new()
 plot.window(range(t),range(elastic_seq))
 points(t,elastic_seq,pch = 16, cex = .75,col = "red")
 axis(1,tcl = 0.75,lwd = 0, family = "serif")
 axis(2,lwd = 0, family = "serif", las = 1)
 grid(2,3,col = "gray80",lty = "dotted", lwd = 0.50)
 mtext("Ease-out Elastic Sequence",3,cex = 1.3, family = "serif")
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}

```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}

```
