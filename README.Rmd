This package is born out of curiosity rather than necessity. `sequentially` creates non-linear and linear numeric sequences. By using non-linear interpolation the user can animate their data
in a way that is more visually pleasing than uniform, linear interpolation. The functions in this package represent a break from the **essential** but *boring* `seq()` family of functionsâ€“I wanted to plot numeric sequences could be used in data visualization, motion animation, frame interpolation, UI/UX design, population dynamics, economics and finance.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sequentially like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("sequentially")
```

or download it from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("sequentially")
```


## What you get:

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# library(sequentially)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}

```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}

```
